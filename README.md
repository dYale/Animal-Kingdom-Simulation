####Basic Aggressive Forest Simulation

* Create a population of 25 animals. 
* Each animal has a name, species, color, aggressiveness(bool), strength(int), alive(bool). 
* At the beginning of each day, increase each animal's strength by 1 and have each aggressive animal chooses another animal to fight.  
* At some point during the day the animals fight. 
* The order that the animals fight is random. 
* Each fight results in a loss of strength/health for both animals equal to a dice roll relative to each animals strength.
* Repeat the day until there are no aggressive animals left, or there is only one aggressive animal left. 

* Render the results of the battle to the screen.
